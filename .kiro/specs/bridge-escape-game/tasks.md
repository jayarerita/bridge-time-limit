  - _Requirements: 1.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 8.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement bridge crossing mechanics and validation
  - Write move validation logic in BridgeController (max 2 characters, lantern rules)
  - Create crossing execution method that calculates time and updates positions
  - Implement character movement animations across the bridge
  - Add visual feedback for invalid moves with error messages
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Add lantern system and lighting effects
  - Implement lantern positioning logic that follows characters
  - Create visual lantern sprite with glowing light effect
  - Write lantern movement validation (must accompany crossing characters)
  - Add lantern return mechanism when characters go back
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 6.4_

- [ ] 7. Implement timer system and game state management
  - Create countdown timer display starting at 17 minutes
  - Write timer update logic that subtracts crossing time from remaining time
  - Implement game over detection when timer reaches zero
  - Add victory condition detection when all characters reach safety
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 8. Create UI components and game state feedback
  - Design and implement timer display with prominent visual styling
  - Add character position indicators showing current side locations
  - Create action buttons for "Cross Bridge" and "Reset Game"
  - Implement status messages for game progress and rule violations
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4_

- [ ] 9. Add win/lose states and game restart functionality
  - Implement game over screen with loss message and restart option
  - Create victory screen with success message and time remaining display
  - Add restart game functionality that resets all game state
  - Write transition animations between game states
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4, 8.3_

- [ ] 10. Optimize for mobile and desktop responsiveness
  - Implement responsive scaling for different screen sizes
  - Add touch-friendly button sizes and spacing for mobile devices
  - Test and adjust input handling for both mouse and touch events
  - Optimize sprite sizes and UI elements for various screen resolutions
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 7.4_

- [ ] 11. Create pixel art assets and visual polish
  - Design 32x32 pixel character sprites for all four characters
  - Create bridge, gorge, and platform background graphics
  - Implement lantern glow effect and atmospheric lighting
  - Add simple walking animations for character movement
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 12. Add comprehensive testing and browser compatibility
  - Write unit tests for Character, GameState, and BridgeController classes
  - Test game functionality across different browsers and devices
  - Validate puzzle solvability and optimal solution paths
  - Perform final testing for GitHub Pages deployment compatibility
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_
